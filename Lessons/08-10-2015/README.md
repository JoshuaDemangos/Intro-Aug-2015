# 08-10-2015 Class

## What was covered
* We had our first standup meeting where we just introduced ourselves seeing as it was the first day.

* We did an orientation presentation where we talked about what we would be learning in the course

* We learned about Git and GitHub and some keywords revolving around the two
	* **Repository** - A location where all the code files for a project are stored
		* **Changelog** - A history of all the changes that were committed to the repository (Also known as the commit history)
		* **Issue Tracker** - A list of to do items relevant to the repository
		* **Star Count** - The number of people that starred the repository (similar to Facebook likes)
		* **Fork Count** - The number of people that have forked this repository
	* **Forking** - Creating your own copy of an existing repository
		* Forks are a one way street. You can always pull from a repository, but you cannot push back without a pull request.
		* Forks are used to either 
			* Use someone elses repository as the basis of your own
			* Propose changes to someone elses repository without affecting it
	* **Pull Requests** - Asking the owner of a repository to pull changes you made in a fork, back into the original repository.
	
* We did a Git demonstration

* We recapped some basics on HTML and CSS
