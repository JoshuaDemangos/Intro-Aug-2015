# Today's Goals

1. [ ] 09:30 - Standup Meeting

2. [ ] 09:35 - Object Oriented Programming Exercises
	* Abstraction - Showing only relevant information and hiding unnecessary details.
		* Example: Bank Account usage in Program.cs
		
		
	* Encapsulation - Combining properties and methods into a class to provide a form of abstraction.
		* Example: Bank Account implementation in Bank.cs and Account.cs
	
	
	* Inheritance - Defining a base class and extending/overriding its properties/methods in child classes. "The child can do everything the parent can do, and more."
		* Overriding - A child class providing a different implementation than it's parent class
		* Virtual - Specifying a base method that can optionally be overridden
		* Example: Animal/Cat/Dog
		
		
	* Polymorphism 
		* Subtyping - Defining abstract methods on a base class and implementing them in child classes
			* Example: Animal/Cat/Dog
		* Overloading - Creating multiple versions of a method with different parameters
			* Example: Math Library
			
3. [ ] 10:00 - 07-ObjectOrientedProgramming

4. [X] 13:00 - Continue working on 07-ObjectOrientedProgramming

5. [X] End of Class - Introduction to 08-Pong
