# Before you get here

## Requirements

### You need to bring a laptop.
Most of the course will involve building programs on your own computer. You won't get anything out of the course without a laptop.

### Your laptop should be able to run Windows.
As you will be learning how to use the .NET framework provided by Microsoft to build programs, your laptop will need to be able to run Windows.  
(**Note**: While it is possible to write and compile code for the .NET framework on OSX and various Linux distributions - we will be focused on teaching only in Windows. I want to encourage students helping eachother, and having everybody use Windows helps achieve that goal.) 

Don't worry - if you don't have Windows, we can give you a copy through our BizSpark subscription.

If you are bringing a MacBook - there are several ways you can get Windows running on your laptop. I personally recommend using [Parallels Desktop ($79.99)](http://www.parallels.com/products/desktop/) or [VirtualBox (Free)](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads) to create a Windows virtual machine on your Mac.
 I highly recommend this over doing something like BootCamp as it is less risky to setup virtual machines than it is to repartition your hard drive.
## Required Tasks

### Signup for these Accounts
* [ ] [GitHub](https://www.github.com) - You will use this to store your assignments.
* [ ] [WakaTime](https://wakatime.com/signup) - You will use this to track the hours you spend coding.
* [ ] [Portfolium](https://www.portfolium.com) - Once you finish the course you will eventually be looking for a job. Portfolium is like a smarter LinkedIn. You'll post your best projects here where prospective employers can see them.

### Install these applications
* [ ] [Git command line utility](https://www.git-scm.com) - You will use this in command prompt to communicate with GitHub.
* [ ] [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) - You will use this to edit HTML, CSS and JavaScript files. It is a great plain text editor with basic Git integration.
* [ ] [Visual Studio Community](https://www.visualstudio.com/products/visual-studio-community-vs). **Just download this for now**. We will install this together in class. You will use this to build applications on top of the .NET Framework.

### Complete these online courses
* [ ] [GitHub Tutorial](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/) - Learn about the basics of GitHub
* [ ] [Git Tutorial](https://try.github.io/levels/1/challenges/1) - Learn about the basics of Git
* [ ] [Codecademy - HTML & CSS](https://www.codecademy.com/tracks/web) - Learn about the basics of HTML & CSS
* [ ] [Codecademy - JavaScript](https://www.codecademy.com/tracks/javascript) - Learn about the basics of JavaScript

### Check out these useful tools
* [Google](http://www.google.com) - Google will make your life much easier. We encourage you to use it. If you get stuck, do a Google search for the problem you're having and you'll more than likely find blog posts, tutorials, stack overflow answers and more related to your question. **Again, we highly encourage and allow the use of Google.**
* [Stack Overflow](http://www.stackoverflow.com) - You will get stuck at some point, and you will need to ask for help. Stack Overflow is a great place to find this help. You can search and find out if your question has already been answered, and if it hasn't - you can post a question and get the answer you need.


## Suggested Tasks

Nothing in this section is required for you to take the course - this is just a recommendation of extra "things to do" to further prepare yourself for 3 months of coding.

### Websites
* [General Typing Practice](http://www.keybr.com/#!game) - You will be doing lots of typing in this course, the better you are with a keyboard the easier the course will be.
* [Code Typing Practice](https://typing.io/lesson/javascript/jquery/traversing.js/1) - You will be typing a lot of code in this course. This site will ask you to type the code you see on the screen, forcing you to type characters you normally wouldn't in a non-coding scenario.
* [Pluralsight](https://www.pluralsight.com/) - Pluralsight has great courses on pretty much any language/library you can think of. We recommend you use this sight both during the course and after.

### Technical Books
* [HTML and CSS: Design and Build Websites](http://www.amazon.com/HTML-CSS-Design-Build-Websites/dp/1118008189/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1439695242&sr=1-1&keywords=programming+books) - The most thorough/not boring book on HTML and CSS that there is.
* [JavaScript and JQuery: Interactive Front-End Web Development](http://www.amazon.com/JavaScript-JQuery-Interactive-Front-End-Development/dp/1118531647/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1439695692&sr=1-1&keywords=jquery) - From the same author, same deal - but with JavaScript/jQuery.
