#HTML/CSS Assignment

In this assignment, we will be creating a very simple 4 page website that's all about you.

The first page will be the landing page, and contain links to the other 3 pages.
Each of the 3 pages will correspond to a category of your choice. For example, I chose **Fruit**, **Video Games** and **Movies**.
These 3 categories can be anything you want, but they must all contain 4 examples of things you like in that category.
