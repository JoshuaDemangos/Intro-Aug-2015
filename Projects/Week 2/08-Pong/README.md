# Notepad
In this assignment, you will be creating Pong using the Unity framework and C#.

You'll be forking an existing repository and making changes to the project to get the game to work. The remainder of this course will be using what you've learned to improve on this basic game. 

## Tasks
**1. Fork the Pong repository**
* Go to [this repository](https://github.com/cameronoca/07-Pong)
* Click the Fork button to create a copy of this repository in your account that you can push/pull from.
* Clone this repository to ```C:\dev\projects\```

**2. Open the project in Unity**
* Open Unity from the Start Menu
* Click "Open Other"
* Select the ```C:\dev\projects\08-Pong``` **folder**.

**3. Open the main_scene file**

At this point, your task will be to complete this game of pong. The scene has been setup, all that's left to do is add the two rackets, the ball - and the game logic necessary to make everything move.

The goal of this assignment is to do as much to this game of pong as you can until the end of class.

There is a tutorial you can follow [here](http://noobtuts.com/unity/2d-pong-game), this tutorial was the basis for this project.
